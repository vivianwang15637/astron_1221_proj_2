    "# ISS Pass Predictor & Logger\n",
    "\n",
    "This project builds a tool to predict when the International Space Station will be visible from your location and track your observation history. We use Skyfield to calculate satellite passes and Pandas to organize and analyze the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What This Does\n",
    "\n",
    "The ISS orbits Earth roughly every 90 minutes, but you can only see it when it passes overhead during twilight. This notebook automates the prediction process and helps you keep track of which passes you actually manage to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you can do:**\n",
    "- Download current ISS orbital data from Celestrak\n",
    "- Get predictions for visible passes over the next 7 days\n",
    "- Store everything in easy-to-use DataFrames\n",
    "- Log your actual observations with weather conditions\n",
    "- See how accurate the predictions are\n",
    "- Generate charts showing pass frequency and success rates\n",
    "- Save everything to CSV files for later\n",
    "\n",
    "## Astronomy Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The International Space Station completes one orbit every 90 minutes. A \"pass\" happens when it flies overhead and becomes visible—it looks like a bright star moving across the sky. To predict these passes, we need TLE (Two-Line Element) data, which contains all the orbital information. The ISS orbit changes slightly each day due to atmospheric drag, so we need fresh data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Altitude** is how high the ISS appears in the sky, measured in degrees:\n",
    "- 0° = horizon\n",
    "- 30° = good viewing (above most buildings and trees)\n",
    "- 90° = directly overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "Passes above 30° are usually the easiest to spot because they're high enough to clear most obstructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "We're using **Pathway B** for this project, which combines:\n",
    "- **Skyfield** for satellite orbit calculations\n",
    "- **Pandas** for data organization and analysis\n",
    "- **Astropy** for coordinate transformations\n",
    "- **Matplotlib** for making charts\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download current ISS TLE data from Celestrak\n",
    "2. Calculate visible passes for your location using Skyfield\n",
    "3. Put predictions into a DataFrame\n",
    "4. Log your actual observations\n",
    "5. Merge predictions with observations to compare\n",
    "6. Analyze the data and make visualizations\n",
    "7. Save everything to CSV files\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "**Celestrak** provides free, regularly-updated TLE data for satellites. The ISS has NORAD ID 25544, and we download its TLE data directly from their website. This data gets updated daily because the orbit changes slightly over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skyfield** uses JPL DE421 ephemeris data, which contains precise positions of Earth, Sun, Moon, and planets. This lets us calculate exactly where the ISS will appear in the sky. The ephemeris file is about 10MB and downloads automatically the first time you run the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is organized into clear sections:\n",
    "1. **Setup and Dependencies** - Install libraries and configure location\n",
    "2. **Data Acquisition** - Download TLE data and set up Skyfield\n",
    "3. **Prediction Pipeline** - Calculate passes and organize into DataFrames\n",
    "4. **Observation Logging** - Record your actual viewing attempts\n",
    "5. **Analysis and Visualization** - Generate statistics and charts\n",
    "6. **Data Export** - Save everything to CSV files\n",

    "\n",
    "This is the core function that predicts when the ISS will be visible. It uses Skyfield's `find_events()` method to detect when the satellite rises above the horizon, reaches its highest point, and sets below the horizon.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. Skyfield calculates the ISS position at many time points\n",
    "2. It detects when altitude crosses our minimum threshold (e.g., 10°)\n",
    "3. For each complete pass, it records:\n",
    "   - **Rise time**: When ISS first appears above horizon\n",
    "   - **Max altitude time**: When ISS reaches highest point\n",
    "   - **Set time**: When ISS disappears below horizon\n",
    "   - **Max altitude**: How high in degrees (0° = horizon, 90° = overhead)\n",
    "   - **Duration**: Total time from rise to set in minutes\n",
    "   - **Brightness**: Apparent magnitude (lower number = brighter star)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we extract for each pass:**\n",
    "- Rise time: when to start watching\n",
    "- Max altitude: how high ISS will appear (higher = easier to see)\n",
    "- Duration: how long we have to observe\n",
    "- Brightness: how bright it will appear (depends on distance and solar angle)\n",

Based on generated predictions you can edit the code to add in what observations really were based on the pass_id of the prediction you decided to observe. After this part, you can run the rest of the code to see how accurate the predictions were and then see this data in a csv to compare prediction with your actual observations.\n",

    "- Limited to 7-day prediction window\n",

    "### Potential Improvements\n",
    "- Automatic TLE updates on each run\n",
    "- Integration with weather APIs for better prediction accuracy\n",
    "- Better brightness calculations accounting for solar phase angle\n",
    "- Mobile app for easy observation logging\n",
    "- Look at patterns across seasons\n",
    "- Alert system for upcoming high-altitude passes\n",
    "- Integration with telescope control software\n"
