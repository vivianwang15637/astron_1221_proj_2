    "**Project Overview**\n",
    "--\n",
    "\n",
    "This project creates a personalized International Space Station (ISS) visibility tracker that predicts when the station passes overhead and maintains a historical log of observations. We'll use Skyfield for satellite predictions while building a Pandas-based database to track and analyze pass patterns over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- Download ISS TLE (Two-Line Element) data from Celestrak\n",
    "- Predict visible passes for the next 7 days using Skyfield\n",
    "- Store predictions in structured DataFrames\n",
    "- Log actual observations with weather and viewing success data\n",
    "- Analyze patterns using Pandas groupby operations\n",
    "- Visualize pass frequencies and observation success rates\n",
    "- Persist data to CSV files for cross-session continuity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Astronomy Context:**\n",
    "The International Space Station orbits Earth every ~90 minutes. A \"pass\" occurs when it flies overhead and becomes visible - appearing as a bright moving star. TLE data contains orbital parameters that enable software to predict satellite positions. Altitude refers to height above the horizon in degrees (0° = horizon, 90° = directly overhead). Passes above ~30° altitude are easiest to observe.\n",

    "**Pathway B: Pandas + Astropy + Skyfield**\n",

    "- **Pandas**: Data manipulation, filtering, and analysis\n",
    "- **Astropy**: Astronomical coordinate transformations and constellation identification\n",
    "- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization and plotting\n",

    "**Data Pipeline:**\n",
    "1. Acquire current ISS TLE data from Celestrak\n",
    "2. Calculate visible passes for user location\n",
    "3. Structure predictions in DataFrame format\n",
    "4. Log observations with metadata\n",

    "- **pandas**: Core data manipulation and analysis tool. We'll use this to store predictions in DataFrames, filter passes, and perform groupby operations.\n",
    "- **numpy**: Numerical computing foundation that pandas is built upon.\n",
    "- **matplotlib**: Visualization library for creating charts and plots of pass frequencies.\n",
    "- **skyfield**: Specialized library for satellite orbit calculations and predicting when satellites are visible.\n",
    "- **astropy**: Astronomical coordinate transformations for identifying constellations and working with celestial coordinates.\n",
    "- **requests**: HTTP library for downloading TLE data from Celestrak website.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Notes:**\n",
    "- Run the installation cell below before proceeding to imports\n",
    "- The installation may take 1-2 minutes depending on your internet connection\n",
    "- Skyfield will automatically download ephemeris data (~10MB) on first use - this is normal\n",

    "### 2.1 Function to Calculate Visible Passes\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the core function that predicts when the ISS will be visible. It uses Skyfield's `find_events()` method to detect when the satellite rises above the horizon, reaches its highest point, and sets below the horizon.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. Skyfield calculates the ISS position at many time points\n",
    "2. It detects when altitude crosses our minimum threshold (e.g., 10°)\n",
    "3. For each complete pass, it records:\n",
    "   - **Rise time**: When ISS first appears above horizon\n",
    "   - **Max altitude time**: When ISS reaches highest point\n",
    "   - **Set time**: When ISS disappears below horizon\n",
    "   - **Max altitude**: How high in degrees (0° = horizon, 90° = overhead)\n",
    "   - **Duration**: Total time from rise to set in minutes\n",
    "   - **Brightness**: Apparent magnitude (lower number = brighter star)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we extract for each pass:**\n",
    "- Rise time → when to start watching\n",
    "- Max altitude → how high ISS will appear (higher = easier to see)\n",
    "- Duration → how long we have to observe\n",
    "- Brightness → how bright it will appear (depends on distance and solar angle)\n",
    "\n",
    "The function returns a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains information about one pass."

    "This project calculates ISS passing predictions based on ISS TLE data from Celestrack. Based on generated predictions you can edit the code to add in what observations really were based on the pass_id of the prediction you decided to observe. After this part, you can run the rest of the code to see how accurate the predictions were and then see this data in a csv to compare prediction with your actual observations."
